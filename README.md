# Calculus_2
This repository provides code and resources for Manim, focusing on the definition and application of Double Integrals over General Regions in Calculus 2.

## Key Concepts

* Definition: Integrating over 2D shapes with curved boundaries, using function-based limits.
* Application: Provide some applications of Double Integrals over General Regions, especially in Computer Science.
* Example & Visualization: Practical calculation examples with visual representations of the integration regions and their boundaries.
* Conclusion: Emphasizes setting correct limits based on the region's shape and order of integration.
* References: Sources for further learning.
